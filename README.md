# Basic Chaum-Pedersen NIZKP

The non-interactive version of original Chaum-Pedersen protocol. This project is purposed to be used with public key cryptosystem based on "Discrete Logarithm" such as ElGamal.

The Fiat-Shamir protocol is applied to Chaum-Pedersen protocol to make it non-interactive.

You should first initialize the system with a Cyclic Group and that's it.
